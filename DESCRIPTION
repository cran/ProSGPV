Description: Implementation of penalized regression with second-generation p-values for variable
    selection. The algorithm can handle linear regression, GLM, and Cox regression. S3 methods print(), summary(), coef(), predict(), and plot() are available for the algorithm. Technical details
    can be found at Zuo et al. (2021) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2021.1946150>.

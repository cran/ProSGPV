Description: Implementation of penalized regression with second-generation p-values for variable
    selection. The one-stage algorithm is extremely fast and the two-stage algorithm has lower
    parameter estimation bias when data are highly correlated. S3 methods print(),
    summary(), coef(), and predict() are available for both algorithms,
    and S3 method plot() is available for the two-stage algorithm. Technical details
    of the algorithms can be found at <arXiv:2012.07941>.
